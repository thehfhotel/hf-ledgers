# Expense Ledger

HF Hotel's company expense ledger: a custom Bun frontend backed by a headless
[ezBookkeeping](https://ezbookkeeping.mayswind.net/) engine. Public repo — see
CLAUDE.md's public-repo hygiene rule (no LAN IPs, no internal topology).

## Commands

```sh
bun install
bun run dev          # Bun --hot on http://localhost:3000
bun run build         # scripts/build.ts -> dist/client
bun run start          # NODE_ENV=production bun src/server/server.ts
bun run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
bun test               # server.test.ts drives fetchHandler directly; the AP register's
                       # apStore.test.ts/server.test.ts AP suites use bun:sqlite against
                       # temp files (AP_DB_PATH), never the real /app/data/ap.db path
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck, `bun test`, then build, on every
push and PR. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs the same gate before pushing
the frontend image and deploying — a red test suite cannot reach production.

**Repo status**: the deploy job will fail on GitHub Actions until the
one-time host setup below is done (SSH key + forced-command shim on
evergreen) and the `EVERGREEN_EXPENSE_LEDGER_DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` /
`EVERGREEN_HOST_KEY` secrets exist on this repo. That is expected for a
freshly-created repo — CI (typecheck/test/build) still passes and gates PRs
either way.

## One-time host setup (evergreen)

Same forced-command SSH deploy pattern as every other estate app (income-ledger,
hf-erp-portal, payroll, room-daily-reporter) — each app gets its **own**
ed25519 key pinned to its **own** forced-command shim; see `HF-erp/DEPLOY.md`
for the full walkthrough (that repo owns the shim template,
`scripts/deploy/run-deploy.sh`, and the estate's Cloudflare-as-code).

```sh
# 1. Generate a NEW ed25519 key for this app.
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -f /tmp/evergreen-expense-ledger-deploy \
  -C "gh-actions@thehfhotel-expense-ledger" -N ""

# 2. On evergreen as root: install a shim adapted from HF-erp's
#    scripts/deploy/run-deploy.sh template at
#    /srv/run-deploy-expense-ledger.sh (owned root:root, mode 755). Unlike
#    the portal's shim (a static SPA with no runtime secrets), this app's
#    tarball includes a .env — the shim's extract step must place BOTH
#    docker-compose.yml and .env into the deploy dir, then
#    `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans`, then poll
#    http://localhost:4050/healthz.

# 3. APPEND an entry to /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys pinning the new
#    key to the shim:
sudo tee -a /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys > /dev/null <<'EOF'
command="/srv/run-deploy-expense-ledger.sh",restrict ssh-ed25519 PUBKEY_FROM_STEP_1 gh-actions@thehfhotel-expense-ledger
EOF

# 4. Add GitHub secrets on this repo:
#    EVERGREEN_EXPENSE_LEDGER_DEPLOY_SSH_KEY  - private half of the key from step 1
#    EVERGREEN_HOST_KEY                        - already exists org-wide, reuse it
#    ENGINE_API_TOKEN, ACCESS_AUD, ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN (optional, has a default),
#    EBK_SECURITY_SECRET_KEY                   - see "First-boot procedure" below
```

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically (GHCR push/pull).

## First-boot procedure

The engine ships with no users and `EBK_USER_ENABLE_REGISTER=false` by
default in production (see docker-compose.yml). `EBK_SECURITY_ENABLE_API_TOKEN`
also defaults to `true` there (upstream defaults `security.enable_api_token`
to `false`, which rejects API-type tokens outright — `pkg/middlewares/
authorization.go` — and the frontend's `src/server/engine.ts` sends exactly
that kind of token on every call). To create the single ledger account:

**Ordering matters**: `EBK_SECURITY_SECRET_KEY` must already be its FINAL
production value (see "Gotchas" below) before step 3 mints a token — rotating
the secret key invalidates every previously issued token, so a token minted
before the key is finalized stops working the moment the key changes.

The single ledger account's username and password live on evergreen at
`/home/deploy/expense-ledger-production/.admin-credentials` (root:root, mode
600) — never in this repo, never as a GitHub secret.

1. On evergreen, temporarily flip registration on and restart just the
   engine: `EBK_USER_ENABLE_REGISTER=true docker compose up -d engine` (or
   edit the deployed `.env` and re-run `docker compose up -d engine`, then
   revert).
2. Reach the engine over the loopback host-port mapping (`127.0.0.1:4051`) —
   e.g. an SSH tunnel from your laptop — and register the one account through
   ezBookkeeping's own UI.
3. Sign in, then **Settings > API token** and mint a token as
   **non-expiring** (`expiresInSeconds=0` — pick "never expires" if the UI
   offers an expiry choice; an expiring token silently breaks the frontend's
   engine client the moment it lapses, surfacing as `engine_unreachable`).
   That value is `ENGINE_API_TOKEN` — set it as a GitHub secret and redeploy
   so the frontend's `src/server/engine.ts` client can use it.
4. Set `EBK_USER_ENABLE_REGISTER` back to `false` (the compose default) and
   redeploy, so the registration page can never create a second account.

## Migration runbook

One-time (or monthly, for a new month's workbook) steps to seed the chart of
accounts/categories and import a paper Excel workbook into the engine.
`scripts/seed.ts` and `scripts/import-workbook.ts` are plain `bun` scripts —
they talk to the engine directly over its loopback host-port mapping
(`127.0.0.1:4051`), the same way an operator reaches it in the "First-boot
procedure" above (from evergreen itself, or an SSH tunnel from your laptop).
They read `EBK_URL` (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:4051`) and `EBK_TOKEN` —
`EBK_TOKEN` can be the exact same API token minted in first-boot step 3
(the one set as the `ENGINE_API_TOKEN` GitHub secret); it's just exported
under a different env var name here because these scripts run from an
operator's shell, not inside the frontend container. Both scripts default to
a dry-run that only reads from the engine and prints a plan — pass `--apply`
to actually write.

Exact order:

1. **Engine up.** `docker compose up -d engine` (or confirm it's already
   running: `docker compose ps`).
2. **Registration temporarily on** — see "First-boot procedure" step 1.
3. **Create the ledger user** through ezBookkeeping's own UI over
   `127.0.0.1:4051` — "First-boot procedure" step 2.
4. **Mint a token** — Settings > API token in that UI ("First-boot
   procedure" step 3). Export it locally:
   ```sh
   export EBK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4051   # or your SSH tunnel's local port
   export EBK_TOKEN=<the token you just minted>
   ```
5. **Seed the chart of accounts/categories** (idempotent — safe to re-run):
   ```sh
   bun scripts/seed.ts            # dry-run: prints what it would create
   bun scripts/seed.ts --apply    # creates the 16 primary + secondary
                                   # expense categories and the two
                                   # accounts (เงินสด, ธนาคาร) from
                                   # scripts/categories.json
   ```
6. **Import the month's workbook:**
   ```sh
   bun scripts/import-workbook.ts --file <path-to-workbook.xlsx>            # dry-run
   bun scripts/import-workbook.ts --file <path-to-workbook.xlsx> --apply    # writes + reconciles
   ```
   Re-importing the same month refuses with a clear error unless you pass
   `--force` (which first deletes exactly that month's previously-imported
   transactions, identified by their `import:<YYYY-MM>` tag, before
   re-importing).
7. **The reconciliation table printed at the end of `--apply` must be
   all-zero diffs.** If any row shows a nonzero diff, the script exits 1 —
   treat that month as NOT safely imported until it's investigated (the
   likely causes are a categories.json / column mapping drift, or a
   partially-failed write) and re-run with `--force` once fixed.
8. **Registration off** — set `EBK_USER_ENABLE_REGISTER` back to `false` and
   redeploy, exactly as in "First-boot procedure" step 4.

## Upgrade procedure (engine)

The engine image is consumed from our own GHCR mirror, pinned by digest in
`docker-compose.yml` — never a moving tag, and never built from our source
fork.

1. Check upstream's release notes
   (`github.com/mayswind/ezbookkeeping/releases`) for the new version, and
   check Dependabot alerts on our source fork
   (`github.com/thehfhotel/ezbookkeeping`) for anything urgent. The fork
   exists purely as insurance if upstream ever disappears — we do not build
   images from it under normal operation.
2. Run the mirror workflow for the new tag (Docker Hub tag naming has no
   leading `v`, e.g. `1.7.0`):
   ```sh
   gh workflow run mirror-engine.yml -f tag=1.7.0
   ```
3. Once it succeeds, read the digest it printed to the job summary and bump
   the `engine.image` line in `docker-compose.yml` to
   `ghcr.io/thehfhotel/ezbookkeeping@sha256:<new digest>`.
4. Commit, push, let the normal deploy pipeline ship the compose change,
   then verify the engine container came up healthy
   (`docker compose ps`, `curl http://localhost:4051/healthz.json` from the
   host).

## Backup

**On evergreen:** a systemd timer, `expense-ledger-backup.timer` (03:30
Bangkok time nightly, `Persistent=true` so a down host still catches up on
next boot), runs `/usr/local/bin/backup-expense-ledger.sh` as root — systemd
timer, not cron, because this host has no cron package installed at all
(every other per-app estate backup here — `loyalty-backup`, `seafile-backup`
— already uses a systemd timer for the same reason). It `tar`s BOTH Docker
volumes below, whole-directory (not just the `.db` file, so a live
`-wal`/`-shm` sqlite journal sibling is captured too), into
`/srv/backups/expense/<volume>_<UTC timestamp>.tar.gz`, keeping the most
recent 14 archives per volume. Docker on this host is snap-packaged, which
confines bind-mount source paths to `/home/*` and `/root` (verified: a write
into a bind mount under `/srv` or `/tmp` silently goes nowhere) — so the
script stages each `tar` under a private `/root` subdirectory first, then
does a plain host-level `mv` into `/srv/backups/expense`, never bind-mounting
that directory into a container directly.

*(As of 2026-07-31's AP-register audit, NEITHER this app's volumes nor
income-ledger's own `ledger_data` had any backup coverage at all — this
repo's docs previously claimed a nightly tar "mirroring income-ledger's
arrangement", which did not exist on either side. The mechanism above is
what's actually installed now; income-ledger's equivalent gap is a separate,
not-yet-addressed follow-up outside this repo.)*

- **`expense_data`** (the engine's own volume): holds the engine's SQLite
  database (`/ezbookkeeping/data/ezbookkeeping.db`) and, per
  `EBK_STORAGE_LOCAL_FILESYSTEM_PATH` in docker-compose.yml, all uploaded
  receipt photos under `/ezbookkeeping/data/storage` — everything the engine
  owns lives under that one mount, so one volume backup covers both the
  ledger and every receipt image.
- **`expense_ap`** (the AP register's — "ค้างจ่าย" tab — own volume,
  `/app/data/ap.db`, the FRONTEND container's own bun:sqlite database — see
  CLAUDE.md's "AP register storage exception"): a genuinely separate backup
  target from `expense_data`, since it lives on a different container and
  holds creditor/due-date/payment-history bookkeeping that has no
  ezBookkeeping equivalent — losing it would lose the register even though
  every posted payment is still separately recoverable from the engine's own
  transaction history (see "AP register reconciliation" below). This same
  volume also holds every AP row's own รูปบิล (bill/invoice photos) under
  `/app/data/ap-photos/<rowId>/<photoId>.<ext>` — the whole-directory `tar`
  above already covers them alongside `ap.db`, no separate backup step
  needed. Photo growth will inflate this 14-day full-tar retention over time
  (plausibly several GB/year at real usage, since every full `tar` captures
  every still-retained photo again) — watch free space on evergreen as รูปบิล
  adoption grows.

Restoring either volume: stop the affected container, extract the chosen
archive over the volume's data directory (`docker run --rm -v
<volume>:/target -v /srv/backups/expense:/backup:ro alpine sh -c "rm -rf
/target/* && tar xzf /backup/<archive> -C /target"`), then restart.

## AP register reconciliation

`scripts/reconcile-ap.ts` (report-only, never writes) diffs the AP
register's own payment rows against every `ap:<rowId>`-tagged transaction in
the engine, and reports:

- **dangling local payments** — an `ap_payment` row whose linked transaction
  id no longer exists in the engine at all (e.g. a payment-undo whose
  compensating step failed after the engine-side delete already succeeded),
- **orphan engine transactions** — an `ap:`-tagged engine transaction with no
  local `ap_payment` row referencing it (e.g. the ledger posted but the
  local insert failed, and even the compensating delete failed).

Exits 1 on any mismatch, 0 (with "OK") otherwise; a register that has never
been used yet (no `ap.db` file) is trivially clean and needs no engine call
at all.

This is the one script in `scripts/` that also needs DIRECT read access to
the AP register's own sqlite file (`src/server/apStore.ts`'s `ap.db` — this
repo's one database of its own, CLAUDE.md's "AP register storage exception")
alongside the usual engine access — there is no HTTP surface for that store.
Since `scripts/` ships inside the production image (`Dockerfile`'s `COPY
scripts ./scripts`, both stages), the simplest way to reach both at once is
to run it INSIDE the already-running `expense-ledger` container, where
`/app/data/ap.db` is already the real, correctly-mounted file (no
`AP_DB_PATH` override needed) and the engine is reachable at its
compose-network hostname:

```sh
docker exec expense-ledger sh -c \
  'EBK_URL=http://expense-ledger-engine:8080 EBK_TOKEN=$ENGINE_API_TOKEN \
   bun scripts/reconcile-ap.ts'
```

(`EBK_TOKEN` reuses the container's own `ENGINE_API_TOKEN` — same
credential, read via a different env var name purely because that is this
script family's existing convention, see "Migration runbook" above.) Running
it from an operator's own shell instead (over an SSH tunnel to the engine's
loopback port, `EBK_URL` defaulting to `http://127.0.0.1:4051`) also works
for the engine side, but still needs `AP_DB_PATH` pointed at a copy of the
sqlite file — extract one first with `docker run --rm -v expense_ap:/from:ro
-v /root:/to alpine cp /from/ap.db /to/ap-snapshot.db` (run as root, since
snap-packaged Docker on evergreen only bind-mounts `/home/*`/`/root` — see
"Backup" above).

## ezBookkeeping API notes (dev reference)

Verified against the upstream source at tag `v1.6.1`
(`pkg/api/transaction_pictures.go`, `cmd/webserver.go`,
`pkg/models/transaction_picture_info.go`) — the frontend needs this for
receipt-photo upload, wrapped by `src/server/engine.ts`'s
`uploadTransactionPicture()`:

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/transaction/pictures/upload.json`
- **Auth**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (an ezBookkeeping API token or
  session JWT — same auth as every other `/api/v1/*` route)
- **Request**: `multipart/form-data` with a file field named `picture`
  (required, non-empty, must be a supported image extension), plus an
  optional `clientSessionId` string field the engine uses to dedupe a
  double-submit of the same upload.
- **Response** (ezBookkeeping's standard envelope): on success,
  `{ "success": true, "result": { "pictureId": "<int64 as string>",
  "originalUrl": "<url>" } }`; on failure, `{ "success": false, "errorCode":
  <int>, "errorMessage": "<string>" }` (e.g. no file, empty file, file too
  large, or an unsupported image type).
- Gated server-side by `user.enable_transaction_picture` (default `true`)
  and bounded by `user.max_transaction_picture_size` (default 10 MiB) in the
  engine's own config — both untouched by this repo, upstream defaults.

The frontend's `src/server/engine.ts` also wraps the following, verified the
same way (tag `v1.6.1`) and cross-checked against `scripts/lib/ezbk-client.ts`
(the migration scripts' independently-sourced client, which cites
`pkg/models/transaction.go`, `transaction_category.go`, `account.go` and
`pkg/core/context_web.go` directly):

- **Month transaction list**: `GET /api/v1/transactions/list/by_month.json?
  year=&month=&type=3` returns the WHOLE month in one call (no page/count
  cap) — unlike the general `transactions/list.json`, which caps at 50 and
  needs a page loop. `type=3` is `TRANSACTION_TYPE_EXPENSE` (the
  `pkg/models/transaction.go` enum: `MODIFY_BALANCE=1, INCOME=2, EXPENSE=3,
  TRANSFER=4`).
- **Categories**: `GET /api/v1/transaction/categories/list.json?type=2`
  (`CATEGORY_TYPE_EXPENSE=2` — a SEPARATE enum from the transaction type
  above, `pkg/models/transaction_category.go`: `INCOME=1, EXPENSE=2,
  TRANSFER=3`) returns a response **keyed by stringified category type**
  (`result["2"]`), each entry a primary category with a nested
  `subCategories[]`. This app's 21 leaves are seeded (`scripts/seed.ts`) as
  one secondary per `src/shared/categories.ts` group — named by `building`
  for the three building-scoped groups (water/electricity/phone) or by the
  same label as the primary otherwise — so `engine.ts` matches on
  `(primary.name === label, secondary.name === building ?? label)`, never a
  hardcoded id.
- **Accounts**: `GET /api/v1/accounts/list.json` — `category` is a plain
  numeric `AccountCategory` enum (`pkg/models/account.go`: `CASH=1,
  CHECKING=2`); this app's two seeded accounts (เงินสด / ธนาคาร) are matched
  on that field, not by name.
- **Create/modify/delete**: `POST /transactions/add.json` /
  `/transactions/modify.json` / `/transactions/delete.json`. Modify is a
  FULL OVERWRITE (every field required, not a patch) — `engine.ts` fetches
  the current transaction (`GET /transactions/get.json?id=`) before any
  single-field edit or photo attach/detach so untouched fields are resent
  unchanged. `time` is Unix seconds; `sourceAmount` is the smallest currency
  unit, numerically identical to this app's own satang for THB.
- **Timezone headers**: `X-Timezone-Name` (e.g. `Asia/Bangkok`) and
  `X-Timezone-Offset` (minutes, `420` for Bangkok) are sent on every call —
  `pkg/core/context_web.go`'s `GetClientTimezone()` is consulted broadly
  across transaction/account endpoints and errors without a resolvable one.

## Gotchas

- The engine's default local-filesystem storage path (`storage/`, for
  receipt photos and avatars) resolves to `/ezbookkeeping/storage` —
  **outside** the mounted `expense_data` volume, which only covers
  `/ezbookkeeping/data`. docker-compose.yml sets
  `EBK_STORAGE_LOCAL_FILESYSTEM_PATH=/ezbookkeeping/data/storage` to
  redirect it inside the mount; do not remove that env var or receipt
  photos will vanish on the next container recreation.
- `security.secret_key` (`EBK_SECURITY_SECRET_KEY`) falls back to the
  literal, publicly-known string `"ezbookkeeping"` if left unset — the
  engine boots fine either way, but that default is insecure for anything
  holding real financial data. Always set it once the ledger has real
  content.
- `security.enable_api_token` (`EBK_SECURITY_ENABLE_API_TOKEN`) defaults to
  `false` upstream, which makes `pkg/middlewares/authorization.go` reject
  API-type tokens outright — the exact kind `src/server/engine.ts` sends as
  a Bearer credential on every call. docker-compose.yml and deploy.yml both
  default this to `true`; don't unset it or the frontend's engine client
  fails every request even with a valid, non-expired `ENGINE_API_TOKEN`.
- **Fresh-volume first boot crash-loops the engine** unless
  `docker-compose.yml`'s `engine-init` one-shot service runs first. Upstream's
  `docker/docker-entrypoint.sh` (verified at tag `v1.6.1`) execs the server
  directly with no setup step, and its `Dockerfile` only pre-creates the
  *default* `/ezbookkeeping/storage` at build time — it has no idea we've
  redirected storage to `/ezbookkeeping/data/storage` via
  `EBK_STORAGE_LOCAL_FILESYSTEM_PATH` (see the gotcha above). On a brand new
  `expense_data` volume that directory doesn't exist, so the engine refuses
  to boot with `cannot load configuration, because invalid local file
  system storage path` and restarts forever. `engine-init` runs
  `mkdir -p /ezbookkeeping/data/storage` against the same volume (using the
  same pinned engine image, so its shell/user behavior needs no separate
  verification) and `engine` only starts once it exits 0
  (`depends_on: engine-init: condition: service_completed_successfully`).
  It's a no-op on every later deploy since the directory already exists —
  safe to leave in place permanently, not just for the first boot.
